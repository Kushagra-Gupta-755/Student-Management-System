# Student-Management-System
This project creates a simple Student Management System using Python programming and mySql. This program creates a user-friendly and interactive database of students &amp; their information which makes it easy to look them up at a click of a button.

# Tools and Technologies Used
This Python project employs MySQL for database management. The graphical interface is designed using the Tkinter library and enhanced with ttkthemes. Additional tools include time, messagebox, filedialog, and the PIL library for image handling. The project also utilizes the pymysql library for MySQL connectivity and integrates pandas for efficient data manipulation.

# Project Design
**Data Flow:**
1.	Input: User inputs through the Tkinter-based graphical interface.
2.	Processing: Python scripts manage data validation, database interactions (using pymysql), and algorithmic calculations for grades and attendance.
3.	Output: Processed data is displayed on the GUI, and reports are generated for analysis.
   
**Algorithms:**
1.	User Authentication: Verify login credentials securely using authentication algorithms.
   
**Architectural Design:**
1.	Frontend: Tkinter and ttkthemes create a responsive and visually appealing GUI.
2.	Backend: Python scripts handle data processing, validation, and algorithm implementation.
3.	Database: MySQL serves as the relational database for efficient data storage and retrieval.
4.	Libraries: Utilize libraries such as pymysql for database connectivity and pandas for data manipulation.
